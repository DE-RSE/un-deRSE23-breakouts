# deRSE23 unconference break-outs 

Welcome to the repository for the deRSE Unconference 2023 break-out sessions. 

*(For short talks please see https://un-derse23.sciencesconf.org)*

## Form the program

We will form the program of this event together :handshake: 
Please post ideas for sessions as [issues](). You need to have a GitHub account in order to do so.

- :bulb: Open a new issue for a new idea.
- :cherries: Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the break-out idea.

:information_desk_person:
*Please make sure that your break-out session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible.* 
:information_desk_person:

We will decide on the final program **on a date TBD**.

If you run into any problems with this process, please contact the program chairs [Heidi Seibold](mailto:heidi@seibold.co) and/or [Robert Speck](mailto:r.speck@fz-juelich.de).
